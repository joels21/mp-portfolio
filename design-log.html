            <p>Learned the basics of photography and the later used the camera to take images using different techniques from the different settings on the camera.</p>
            <p>I will use these basics as a foundation for my site and the different types of media that will feature on my site.</p>
            <p>Used a camera to take some images and see what I need to improve on and how to use the camera correctly and I also attempted some techniques for future reference.</p>

<h5>week 1-Tuesday</h5>

<p>I will implement this into my work because it is very important because this will make my website fully functional and benefits the person using my website.</p>
<p>I will implement this into my work by choosing the right size, the size is measured with height and width using the right mathematical ratio.&nbsp;</p>


<h5>week 1-Friday</h5>

<p>Learned how to inspect all the different elements on my site using firefox.com and also making sure I also make commits and push up my progress to github.com.</p>

<p>On this day I was giving a group task where we had to take 6 different pictures, each different picture needed a different photographic skill.</p>

<p>I will use the information I have learned on the website for my images because now I know what setting complement each other.</p>
<h5>week 2-Tuesday</h5>
<p>Used the website unsplash.com to browse the possible images I may want to use on my website. After that I learned how to transfer these images on to my website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was introduced to photoshop and all the different things you could do on photoshop such as changing the colours or the contrast of an image.</p>
<p>I will implement what I have learned by putting the image I have chosen onto my website. To do this correctly I will have to choose an image size that fits onto the site and also a theme that matches what I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will use the different skills I have learned on photoshop, so I can edit my images to make the images more visually appealing and just better my website overall</p>
<h5>week 2-Wednesday</h5>
<p>Had to read three guides that explained the anatomy of a HTML element and a CSS ruleset. These were dealing with files, basics of HTML and basics of CSS. After I read through these I had to write a Glossary in the HTML CSS collaborative glossary</p>

<p>I can use these sites to help me see what works and what doesn’t work when designing my sites and emulate the parts of the good site to better my site, for example a simple layout is what I prefer when it comes to web design so I will make my site simple to use.</p>
<h5>week 3-Thursday</h5>
<p>Used photoshop to edit the size of the image, so that it is the right size to fit on my website properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learned about consent and how it is such an important part of media. It is such an important part because in the interview parts of the media my group may be interviewing people who are from the public, so you must make sure that you have this persons consent in order to share the media that involves them on your site.</p>
<p>I will implement this into my work by adding the image onto my site and making sure it is the right ratio that my website requires and also choose an image that will be visually appealing and suit the theme of the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will implement this into my work by asking the interviewee if they are ok with the content they are about to participate in is ok to be shared online publicly</p>

I also was introduced into the 180 degree rule which is guideline that two people in the interview should be facing each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I edited my photographs on photoshop such as changing the contrast so it brightened the image, the image was dark because of the weather.</p>
<p>I will implement this by using these skills when doing my group video interview such as the angles of the camera when having the interviewer and interviewee looking at each other even though it is just them in frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will implement this by emulating the progress of the interview step by step such as setting up the camera, getting the right shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I will implement this by seeing where I made mistake so I don’t do them again for future reference.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<h5>week 5-Tuesday</h5>
<p>Learned how to change the icons on my site using fontawesome.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;Filmed the video interview with Kevin Palmer a renowned journalist using the camera equipment.</p>

<h5>week 5-Thursday</h5>
<p>I edited the video interview using Adobe premiere using all the previous skills and techniques I have used previously &nbsp;to make the best video interview I can. I then uploaded it to youtube.com so I can then embed it onto my Portfolio website. We then filmed the audio interview with Steph Petrou the well-being officer at UA92 &nbsp;using the Zoom h6.</p>
<p>I then developed my site by adding the photos to my site and doing final upgrades to the colouring and layout</p>
<p>I will implement this by adding the video to my site onto the video page and also using skills I to edit in order to make sure my video is deemed good enough to feature on there. I will implement the upgrades such as colouring and the layout to my site so &nbsp;my site is accessible and appealing for people to use.</p>
